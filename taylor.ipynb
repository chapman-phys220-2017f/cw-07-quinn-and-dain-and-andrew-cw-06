    "Recall the Taylor expansion formula: $$f(a + y) = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{y^n}{n!}\\left[\\frac{d^n}{dy^n}f(a+y)\\right]{y=0}\\ = f(a) + f'(a)y + f''(a)\\frac{y^2}{2} + \\cdots$$ This formula states that an analytic function $f$ can be approximated by a polynomial series in the region around a domain point $a$, with the polynomial weights determined only by the derivatives of $f$ at the single point $a$. By shifting the domain point to $x = a + y$, we can rewrite the formula as: $$f(x) = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{(x-a)^n}{n!}\\left[\\frac{d^n}{dx^n}f(x)\\right]_{x=a}\\ = f(a) + f'(a)(x-a) + f''(a)\\frac{(x-a)^2}{2} + \\cdots$$ This formulation makes it more clear that the function $f$ at any point $x$ in the domain may be approximated by derivatives at $a$ and the displacements $(x-a)$ away from the point $a$."

    "Time to demonstrate how this approximation works. Define a domain array x of $1000$ points between $[-5,5]$. Define range arrays for the following interesting functions: (1) $f(x) = \\tanh(x)$, (2) $f(x) = x^2/10 + \\sin(2x)/2$, (4) $f(x) = 1/x$ (Hint: use the special value np.nan to represent an undefined range value at $x=0$.) and (3) $f(x) = \\Theta(x)$. (Recall the Heaviside Theta function $\\Theta(x)$ is defined such that it is zero for $x<0$, $1$ for $x >0$ and $1/2$ for $x = 0$.) For each of these functions, plot the function and the Taylor approximations of the function for $n=0,1,2,3,4,5$ around a few interesting points. (Make a separate plot showing approximations for each point you choose to expand around, for each function. Draw a dot on the graph on the chosen point in each case to make it clear which point you are considering. Label your plots accordingly to make it clear what you are showing.)"
